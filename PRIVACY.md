# Privacy Policy

Explorer to Arkham respects your privacy. This extension does **not** collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

## Data Collection
- The extension does not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
- The extension does not collect browsing history, financial information, authentication details, or any other sensitive data.
- All logic runs locally in your browser.

## How It Works
The extension simply listens for clicks on links that match a known list of blockchain explorer domains (e.g., etherscan.io, mempool.space).  
If a link matches, it opens the equivalent Arkham Intelligence page instead.  
No data ever leaves your browser.

## Third-Party Sharing
- No data is shared with third parties.
- No analytics or tracking is included.
